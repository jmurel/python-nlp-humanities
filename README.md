# Learn Text Analysis in Python for Humanities Research Workshop

This repository holds the notebooks and text data used for the Text Analysis in Python for Humanities Workshop. Here is a breakdown of materials:

## Notebooks
 - **text-mining:** Used during first half of the workshop. This notebook introduces users to Python data types/structures, functions, loops, conditionals, and basic Python synatx through a typical text mining and cleaning use case.

 - **test-analysis:** Used during second half of the workshop. This notebook furthers users' experience reading and writing Python code, as well as reading documentation, by implementing text cleaning tools for a small corpus of text files and analyzing the corpus with two common NLP tools: topic models and word embeddings.

The materials are posted here for those who want to clone the repository and work through the notebooks asynchronously. Keep in mind that, should you download and run the materials locally, you will need to change select files paths in the notebooks, which are currently set up to mount Google Drive and run on Colab.
